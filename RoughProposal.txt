What problems our project solves:
-Modern consumer electronic device interfaces often follow a purely menu based system to handle user input. For example, if an 
individual wants to send a text on his smartphone, he has to navigate through a lock screen, an app selection screen, and possibly
additional menus depending on his messaging software. When designing this interface system, operating system developers had a 
couple of conflicting requirements they needed to balance. Smarthpones needed a wide range of user functionality, but they also 
needed to allow fast access to individual capabilities. Menu based systems provided a balance between the two demands, but were 
inherently unoptimal for navigating large volumes of tasks, or minimizing the time needed to access functions. 
    The essential innovation of the finity gauntlet is to provide an interface optimized for time. The human hand is cabable of 
producing a large array of gestures in a fraction of a second. An interface predicated on detecting these gestures would be 
fast. Users would not need to bother looking at a screen, or talking to a microphone. With a twitch of their hand in a fraction 
of a second, they could send a terse message, or activate one of a wide variety of peripherals. TODO Societal impact? I'm not
entirely sure what that would be.
